# Tic Tac Toe TF
## What Is This
Tic Tac Toe TF is a demonstration of ways that a computer may play tic tac toe against a player. It features methods for player vs player and player vs computer. The computer has a number of different strategies it uses featuring random play, algorithmic play, Q-Tabular play and Neural Network play. Faisal and I developed game.py and algorithm.py during the online coding 101 intensive course at Tufts for our project and I have continued to heavily add on to the project since then.
## Support
Tic Tac Toe TF supports many different ways of running. The project can easily be cloned into repl.it and to switch to different files please edit the .replit file. There is also a preinstalled pipfile and lock file for pipenv for easy and clean dependency installation. Lastly there is a premade .vscode file if you want to start manipulating the code.
